The following are the environment prerequisites:
 
You will need _make_ installed in your environment.

    #In debian based systems (e.g., ubuntu, mint, etc):
    sudo apt-get install build-essential

You will need to install some perl dependancies:

    #use the cpan tool (it comes with perl), to install perl dependancies:
    cpan install LWP::UserAgent Data::Dump JSON Test::Deep Test::Exception Test::Fake::HTTPD Getopt::Long

Ok, now you can install the actual module after downloading and extracting:

    tar xzvf Diffbot-Client-0.01.tar.gz
    cd Diffbot-Client-0.01
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    sudo make install
